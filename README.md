## RI4WebSci

This repository contains the scripts and data to support the Sounding out the System paper that was presented at the RI4WebSci workshop collocated with Web Science 2021. 

The scripts here create MIDI files from CSV files. They are all contained in the Jupyter notebook.

The MIDI files were recomposed by Alan Chamberlain into a piece of music: Unseen in Sound https://thealanchamberlain.bandcamp.com/track/unseen-in-sound
